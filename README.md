## Customisation

**Color adjustment:**
All shadows and highlights are automatically calculated from color variables. To modify the colors of the figure's skin and clothes, make changes to the defined color variables in the `:root` tag:

```css
:root {
  --color-skin: #fdcc24;
  --color-sweater: #e1181c;
  --color-pants: #0858a8;
  ...
}
```

**Size adjustment:**
The size of all elements is computed relative to the `--width` variable set in the `:root` tag. To maintain the figure's proportions, adjust this variable only:

```css
  :root {
    ...
    --width: 500px;
  }
```
